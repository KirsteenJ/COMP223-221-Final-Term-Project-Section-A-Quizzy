## Purpose of the Software
Quizzy is designed as a personal practice tool for users preparing for various tests. The objective is to provide a simple yet efficient way to create, practice, and evaluate quizzes to enhance learning and test preparation.

### Software Development Process Applied
- **Waterfall Model**: We chose the Waterfall model for its straightforwardness and structured approach, which is conducive to the small scale and well-defined scope of our project.

### Why This Type?
- The Waterfall model allows our team to focus on a thorough requirement analysis and extensive planning at the early stages, ensuring a solid foundation for the rest of the project. Given that our app has a clear set of requirements with a predictable outcome, the sequential design of the Waterfall model suits our needs perfectly.

### Possible Usage
- **Target Market**: Our primary users are students and professionals looking for an effective way to prepare for exams or test their knowledge in specific subjects. Quizzy can be used for self-assessment or in a study group as a collaborative learning tool.

## Software Development Plan

### Development Process
The project is divided into distinct phases in line with the Waterfall model: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance.
